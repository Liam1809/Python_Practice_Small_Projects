# Project Goals

# In this project, you will be using Python Classes to create a game system similar to the popular game series Pokémon. If you’re unfamiliar with Pokémon, it is a game where creatures (Pokémon) battle against each other. Every Pokémon has statistics associated with it like health, level, type, and a name. In this project we’ll make several classes that interact with each other so you can create your own Pokémon battles!

# This project invloved Classes and Inheritance properties

class Pokemon:
    # To create a pokemon, give it a name, type, and level. Its max health is determined by its level. Its starting health is its max health and it is not knocked out when it starts.
    def __init__(self, name, type, level = 5):
        self.name = name
        self.level = level
        self.health = level * 5
        self.max_health = level * 5
        self.type = type
        self.is_knocked_out = False
