# Project Goals

# In this project, you will be using Python Classes to create a game system similar to the popular game series Pokémon. If you’re unfamiliar with Pokémon, it is a game where creatures (Pokémon) battle against each other. Every Pokémon has statistics associated with it like health, level, type, and a name. In this project we’ll make several classes that interact with each other so you can create your own Pokémon battles!

# This project invloved Classes and Inheritance properties
